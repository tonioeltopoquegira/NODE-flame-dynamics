def odeint(func, y0, t, x, *, rtol=1e-7, atol=1e-9, method=None, options=None):
    """Integrate a system of ordinary differential equations.

    Solves the initial value problem for a non-stiff system of first order ODEs:
        ```
        dy/dt = func(t, y), y(t[0]) = y0
        ```
    where y is a Tensor or tuple of Tensors of any shape.

    Output dtypes and numerical precision are based on the dtypes of the inputs `y0`.

    Args:
        func: Function that maps a scalar Tensor `t` and a Tensor holding the state `y`
            into a Tensor of state derivatives with respect to time. Optionally, `y`
            can also be a tuple of Tensors.
        y0: N-D Tensor giving starting value of `y` at time point `t[0]`. Optionally, `y0`
            can also be a tuple of Tensors.
        t: 1-D Tensor holding a sequence of time points for which to solve for
            `y`, in either increasing or decreasing order. The first element of
            this sequence is taken to be the initial time point.
        x: N-D Tensor holding a sequence of velocity perturbations and other inputs necessary for derivative
            model computation
        rtol: optional float64 Tensor specifying an upper bound on relative error,
            per element of `y`.
        atol: optional float64 Tensor specifying an upper bound on absolute error,
            per element of `y`.
        method: optional string indicating the integration method to use.
        options: optional dict of configuring options for the indicated integration
            method. Can only be provided if a `method` is explicitly set.

    Returns:
        y: 1-D Tensor, where the first dimension corresponds to different
            time points. Contains the solved value of y for each desired time point in
            `t`, with the initial value `y0` being the first element along the first
            dimension.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if an invalid `method` is provided.
